# Notes-Taking-App
Nodejs NPM Firebase EJF(Embedded Javascript File) Express. Node.js is a Javascript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Here I have taken the easy steps into building a Note-taking App using Node.js. The Note-taking App we will work on is a simple web application that allows the user to input text and deletes the inputted texts. 
Step 1: Basic Installations

1) Node.js Installation
2) Node Package Manager Initialization
3) Express Framework Installation
4) Body-Parser Installation
5) Work on Our Script.Js File
6) Work on Our Embedded Javascript File
7) Create a Route for Requests and delete functions
8) Setting up the Home Route for the App
9) Setting up a Post Route for the Form
10) Setting up a Delete Route for the Form
11) Start the Server Using Terminal
